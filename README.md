# Wally

A Wayland compositor with an _epic_ tech stack.

## Description

Have you ever felt that with despite all of the hype around fancy new technologies, it's rare to see anyone actually implement something useful with them? Well, this project is here to scratch that itch for you. Built on a powerful trio of newly born technologies that have yet to gain the same footing as their predecessors, Wally is here to entirely displace all that legacy crap, and replace it with shiny new future things.

Specifically, Wally is built on the following foundation:

- **Wayland**
- **Vulkan**
- **Rust**

I know right? With all three pillars, this bad boy is just about unstoppable.

## But why?

Well... because I can? For a proof of concept? Because it's fun? All of these reasons apply to some degree. Don't let it bother you that this projects reason for existence may be a little unclear. Just accept that fact that it exists, and there's nothing you can do about it.
